<div><h2>The six rules for success by Arnold Schwarzenegger:</h2></div>

<h3>Trust Yourself</h3><p><center>This is so hard. Always has been for me.
There is a lot of doubt, especially once you start venturing into new and unknown territories!
Sometimes I struggle with what my ‘niche’ is, so it can be hard for me to build a vision of what I want to become.
In fact, I actually often struggle with too many visions! Oh dear, the list could go on.
But in the video, Arnie stresses that we should dig deep down and ask who we want to be, not what, but who.
What makes us happy? What idea of ourselves makes us happy?</center></p>

<h3>Break Some Rules</h3><p>This one I actually think I’m doing OK at.
I broke the rules by leaving my traditional 9–5, choosing to live a freelance, flexible, entrepreneurial lifestyle. I broke the rules by challenging the traditional means of getting money and by going on a path to discover how import money is and other ways to make it. I broke the rules by moving to a place that is unexpected and somewhat remote, discovering the beauty that can be found there.
I’m not afraid anymore to break the rules.</p>

<h3>Don’t be Afraid to Fail</h3><p>Part of the reason I can afford to take risks is because I’m comfortable financially and relationships-wise, so this make it easier.
That be said, I certainly hold back on the bigger, bolder moves. As Schwarzenegger says, I need to keep pushing, to believe in myself and my vision and keep pushing.</p>

<h3>Ignore the Naysayers</h3><p>I love it when someone says that no one has ever done this before, because then when I do it that means I’m the first one that has done it.
Remember: the biggest naysayer is often yourself.</p>

<h3>Work Like Hell</h3><p>I hate when people say, “I don’t have enough time to work out.” That’s crazy to me. You have 24 hours in a day. Sleep six hours, and you have 18 hours left. Do your job, which probably takes 8–10 hours, and you have at least 10 hours left. You’re telling me you can’t work out in that time?
No-one has ever been successful without working hard.
However, I have to admit that given my previous background and working extremely long hours in my corporate finance job, I’m hesitant to encourage working all the time.
Don’t risk burnout. Work smarter, not harder.
We shouldn’t feel guilty about taking some ‘me’ time either. See my recent</p>

<h3>Give Something Back</h3><p>Whatever path life takes you on, you must always find some time to give something back.
I recently took a voluntary board position at my location college here in Scotland. I have to admit, my motivation to take the position was a little bit selfish (general career progression) but it does amount to a significant amount of volunteered time on my part.
That being said, there’s always opportunity to help others more.
It doesn’t have to be super flashy either: help can be anything from advising a friend’s kid on a college application, helping tidy up after an event, or looking after your friend’s cats.</p>
